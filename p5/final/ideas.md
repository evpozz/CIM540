1.Why are you making this project? What is your motivation
I love music and I wanted a way to merge 'oldies' style music and records to the 'new' way of listening to music.

2.What are your inputs?
Each record is the input. The drop down menu is also a secondary input.

3.What are your outputs?
The song lyrics and music from the Spotify playlist. The background color changes are also an output.

Who is the target audience for your project?
Any music lover that likes oldies music (60s, 70s, or 80s). Even though the main audience of this kind of music is older and not as tech savvy there still is a market of Millenials that like this kind of music.

Where will your project be displayed?
The project can be displayed at record shops and music sections of electronic stores to be a fun interactive way to show records in a new way.
