Hey, where did we go Days when the rains came ? Down in the hollow Playing a new game, Laughing and a-running, hey, hey, Skipping and a-jumping In the misty morning fog with Our, our hearts a-thumping And you, my brown-eyed girl, You, my brown-eyed girl. Whatever happened To Tuesday and so slow
 Going down to the old mine with a Transistor radio.
 Standing in the sunlight laughing Hide behind a rainbow's wall, Slipping and a-sliding
 All along the waterfall
 With you, my brown-eyed girl, You, my brown-eyed girl.
 Do you remember when we used to sing Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah Just like that
 Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah La dee dah.
 So hard to find my way
 Now that I'm all on my own.
 I saw you just the other day, My, how you have grown!
 Cast my memory back there, Lord, Sometime I'm overcome thinking about Making love in the green grass Behind the stadium
 With you, my brown-eyed girl, You, my brown-eyed girl.
 Do you remember when we used to sing Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah Laying in the green grass Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la Dee dah la dee dah la dee dah la D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d...


 I've got sunshine on a cloudy day.
 When it's cold outside I've got the month of May.

 I guess you'd say
 What can make me feel this way?
 My girl (my girl, my girl)
 Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).

 I've got so much honey the bees envy me.
 I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees.

 Well, I guess you'd say
 What can make me feel this way?
 My girl (my girl, my girl)
 Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).

 Hey hey hey
 Hey hey hey
 Ooooh.

 I don't need no money, fortune or fame.
 I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim.

 Well, I guess you'd say
 What can make me feel this way?
 My girl (my girl, my girl)
 Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).

 I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
 With my girl.
 I've even got the month of May
 With my girl
 Talkin' 'bout
 Talkin' 'bout
 Talkin' 'bout
 My girl
 Ooooh
 My girl
 As long as I can talk about my girl...
