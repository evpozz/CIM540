## Elizabeth Pozzuoli

Dedicated, creative and hardworking.

These skills have allowed me to excel in my studies at the University of Miami School of Communication as a public relations major and marketing and interactive media minor.

In high school, I held numerous leadership positions including in the arts, sports and community service.

As an intern at Outside Eyes Limited, a public relations firm, I am attained public relations and communications skills that supplement my classroom instruction.

This past summer, being an intern for Spirit Airlines, I was able to learn that taking the initiative will lead you to lots of new and unexpected opportunities.

At UM, I am the graphic designer at the Student Activities and Student Organizations Office and the assistant PR manager of Distraction Magazine. In addition, I am a member of PRSSA, Zeta Tau Alpha, Orange Festival committee and Miss UM committee. I was recently chosen to be a Vice Chair for the Homecoming Executive Committee .

I am always striving to bring 100 percent to my work. It is my goal to improve and learn from all of my experiences and opportunities.
